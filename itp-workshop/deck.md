## Why Visualize Data?

This excerise [is a play](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats) on [Anscombe's quartet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet). Anscombe's Quartet is a classic example of the importance of visualizing data. In one of her [many](http://www.slideshare.net/openjournalism/amanda-cox-visualizing-data-at-the-new-york-times) [amazing](https://vimeo.com/133608685) lectures and talks, Editor of the [New York Times Upshot, Amanda Cox](https://www.nytimes.com/by/amanda-cox), lists several important reasons for visualizing data.

#### Show Trends 

Great data visualiation can be very effective at commmunicating trends, such as this example from the New York Times on the current NYC Subway situation.

#### Describe Geography

Maps are (understandably) effective when the data has geographic trends. This map shows the presidential voting by county in the South, and when we compare to cotton production from the 1860s, we can see some incredible geographic trends.

<br />

#### Reveal Outliers

Steph Curry's three point shooting is incredible, and undeniably unique when you compare to the rest of the NBA. He broke his record of the most 3's scored in a single season way before the season was over.

<br />

#### Provide Context

  Here we have a map of the Appollo 11 lunar landing compared to a soccer field. You can see that much of the excursion happened in a small area, about the size of half a soccer field.

#### To Explain Complicated Concept

</a>

I'll add one more reason to use data visualization, which is to explain a complex concept. This example from Harvard Medical School uses data visualization to explain how bacteria can mutate to combat antibiotics. 

Other great examples include the [StitchFix Algorithms Tour](http://algorithms-tour.stitchfix.com/) and [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)
